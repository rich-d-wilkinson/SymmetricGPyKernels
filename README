# Symmetric kernels for GPy

This code provides functionality to make a symmetric kernel from any of the stationary GPy kernels. To use it

- Install [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy)
- Download symmetric.py and possibly __init__.py (not sure whether this is needed or not).

Then see the examples. You can view the notebook for a symmetric 2d problem, or HigherD.py or HigherD2.py for more complicated higher dimensional problems.
